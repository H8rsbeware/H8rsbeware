# Hey, I'm Oakley. 
#### Im 22, and from the UK

I am an avid learner, and software engineer. Primarily I focus on Python (Django/Flask),  JS (Framework-less,  I miss the old days), and C#.
Alongside my main languages, I have also invested time (but wouldn't call myself proficient in) C++, C, Elixir, Dart/Flutter, and some others. (Did I mention I like to learn)

There are also several core technologies I understand well including: SQL(ite)/Postgres, Redis, Azure, Git(hub), and more abstract ones like machine learning, etc.
I have a computer science degree (1st w/ Honours), and currently work for IP Integration, see [OakleyIPI](https://github.com/OakleyIPI?tab=overview) for a more accurate commit history.

> I largely don't commit here, as most of my time is spent being a hobbiest in other areas - I'm "too young to program everyday".
> Other fields I enjoy include: Electronics, 3D Printing, Biology (Bioinformatics is a dream for me, one I'm working towards), Keyboards, and anything else based around logic/science!

Disclaimer: Some of my more recent projects use "AI" (ML), specifically EasyCSV. As much as I preferred the days of looking things up and painstakingly taking a day to write a project, there are things I would never spend the time creating without a speed-up. For me, the tools I use are as important, if not more so, than anything - and without "AI", I'd never start, architect, and then program better tools for my (and my coworkers) use, it's just too much time to spare. I understand different opinions, just as much as I understand "AIs" limitations and risks :)
